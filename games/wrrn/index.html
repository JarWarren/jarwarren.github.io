<h2>Development</h2>
<p>
    My first game. The name comes from my last name, <i>Warren</i>, which is a rabbit
    hole.
    <br>
    Built in Godot in 48 hours to simulate the pace of a game jam. All programmer art was done in Ibis
    Paint for iPad.
    <br>
    Art wasn't a focus and two days isn't much time to make good art anyways, but I did learn something from it. While a
    single piece of quality art is difficult to produce - even if you do, many individually good
    assets won't necessarily go well together. Art has to be cohesive and consistent throughout the project.
    <br>
    Bad art aside, I consider the biggest flaw to be the difficulty. It starts out way too hard. I've since
    noticed that a lot of amateur game devs do this on their first games. I guess "too hard" is a mark of
    inexperienced game design.
    <br>
    Being my first full game project, I consider it a success and a milestone.

<h2>Main takeaways</h2>
        There's more to art than making a pretty image.
<br>
        It's ok for a game to feel too easy at the
        beginning.
