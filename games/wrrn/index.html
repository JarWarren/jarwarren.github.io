<h2>Development</h2>
<p>
    Wrrn was my first venture into game dev. It got its name from <i>Warren</i> which is both my last name and a rabbit
    hole.
    <br>
    I built it in Godot in 48 hours to simulate the pace of a game jam. All "programmer art" was done on iPad in Ibis
    Paint.
    While I already knew that a
    single piece of quality art is difficult to produce - what hadn't occurred to me is that many individually good
    assets don't necessarily go well together. Part of the challenge is making your art cohesive.
    <br>
    Still, I consider the biggest flaw to be the difficulty. It starts out way too hard. I've since
    noticed that a lot of other amateur game devs do this on their first games. I guess "too hard" is a mark of
    inexperienced game design.
    <br>
    It was my first full game project though, so I consider it a success and a milestone.

<h2>Main takeaways</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        There is so, so much more to art than making a pretty image.
    </li>
    <li>
        Don't make games too hard without a reason. It's ok to feel "too easy" at the
        beginning.
    </li>
</ul>
