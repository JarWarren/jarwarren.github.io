"Waiting for Godot" 4 to support HTML5
<h2>Development</h2>
<p>
    I only found out about Langton's Ant shortly after implementing the Game of Life.
    Even though they're visually similar, the rules are distinct enough to provide a
    completely different experience.
    <br><br>
    Collisions are undefined by the "official rules" which only
    accommodate a single ant - and I think the game is better played with a single ant -
    but it still felt necessary to allow more than one for fun's sake.
    Since it was up to me, I went with the simplest resolution and made overlapping
    ants kill each other.
    <br><br>
    As before, I couldn't help but to leave in the ability to alter the game's state mid-simulation.
    <br><br>
    One perplexing issue is that if you place enough ants, they skip forward on occasion in order to "keep up".
    I can't tell if this is an issue with Godot or my code, since it (unintuitively) only surfaces at <i>low speeds</i>,
    despite perfect performance at max speed. Either way, state is unaffected and it's only a visual artifact.
    <br><br>
    These are turning out to be fun exercises. I think I'll do one or two more famous projects before
    working on something from my own mind.
