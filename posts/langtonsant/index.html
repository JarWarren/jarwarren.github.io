<h2>Development</h2>
<p>
    Langton's Ant is another cellular automata.
    <br><br>
    The official rules only accommodate a single ant, but I allow as many as you want for fun's sake.
    Since it was up to me, I went with the simplest collision resolution and made overlapping
    ants kill each other.
    <br><br>
    As with Game of Life, I allow altering the state mid-simulation.
    <br><br>
    If you place enough ants, they skip forward on occasion.
    I can't tell if this is an issue with Godot or my code, since it only surfaces at <i>low speeds</i>. It's only a visual artifact and state is unaffected.
