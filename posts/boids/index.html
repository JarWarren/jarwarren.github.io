"Waiting for Godot" 4 to support HTML5
<h2>Development</h2>
<p>
  In my recent adventures across the internet, I came across Boids. It's a fantastic
  introductory project to swarm intelligence and agent-based models, fancy
  terms for the way complex behaviors arise from many individuals following simple rules.
  <br><br>
  This particular algorithm models flocking behavior in boids (bird-oid objects) when 3 rules are
  adhered to.
  <br>
  Cohesion - boids group together.
  <br>
  Separation - boids don't collide.
  <br>
  Alignment - boids steer in the same direction.
  <br><br>
  Like real life birds, boids don't have awareness of all other individuals in the flock,
  so their observance of the rules is only in relation to boids in their vicinity.
  <br><br>
  To make them more lifelike, I added the ability to perch. All of these rules can be toggled off
  to see what difference they make.
  <br><br>
  My favorite part is that the algorithm is easily extended to 3D, so this was my first opportunity to use Godot 3D.
  It's not quite as straightforward as Unity but still very good. In the end, my 3D boids are
  elongated blue prisms that look more like fish than anything else.
