<h2>Development</h2>
<p>
    I love agent-based simulations and went through a phase a little while ago where I built some of the classics.
    The first was Conway's Game of Life.
    <br><br>
    The Game of Life is a famous example of emergence. A phenomenon where the properties of the whole are
    different from the sum of its parts. Individually, cells merely toggle on and off. Together, they exhibit
    complex, lifelike behavior.
    <br><br>
    The board is a single texture tiled across the screen. Live cells are modulated blue.
    Each pass, a new generation is created in memory by visiting every cell and determining
    whether it should live or die. Once the final cell is accounted for, the new generation
    replaces the old, ad infinitum.
    This implementation is a simple, naive one that works great on a small board but definitely doesn't scale.
    <br><br>
    I left in "Acts of God" - the ability to alter the game's state while running. Technically this
    ruins the simulation but it's more fun.
