 Currently "waiting for Godot" 4 to support html5 export. Until then, this page is a WIP.

<h2>Development</h2>
<p>
    Lately I've developed an interest in simulations. Relaxing games
    where the player provides only an initial state and watches it play out.
    <br><br>
    Conway's Game of Life is one that I've personally spent a good few hours playing
    over the years. The simple ruleset makes it very approachable while still being
    sufficiently deep to stay interesting.
    <br><br>
    For the uninitiated, the Game of Life demonstrates <i>emergence</i>; a phenomenon where the properties
    of the whole are different from the sum of its parts. Individually, cells merely toggle
    between on and off - but when put together, they exhibit complex, lifelike behavior.
    <br><br>
    I created the board from a single texture tiled across the screen. Live cells are just modulated blue.
    Each pass, a new generation is created in memory by looping over the cells and determining
    whether they should live or die. Once the final cell is accounted for, the new generation
    replaces the old, ad infinitum.
    <br><br>
    I left in the "Act of God" ability to alter the game's state while running. Technically this
    ruins it, but it's also more fun and I couldn't bring myself to disable it.
